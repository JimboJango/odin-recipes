PRE-WORK
This project is designed to test my skills using Git, basic HTML, and see how well I've integrated the knowledge presented in the lessons so far. 

POST-WORK
The project mostly tested my Git skills. The HTML parts were quite straightforward, a lot of tedious copy-paste, but the Git part was especially important. I had forgotten about "git push origin main" and so it took more time than I'd expected and I started to get quite frustrated.
